<h1>
    <glow><em><strong>SLOW TOWN</strong></em></glow></h1>
     
    
<p>i’d like to be one who wends to where the interests are.<br>
    make me a desirer. put that into my self-portrait’s </p>

<p>conspiratorial eye. i aspire to be slower<br>
than teleology has time for, than any curse can</p>

<p>happen. here we are. the sun’s taken the rose for a ride:<br>
party to van drive ‘cross life: apples core, vital shale-pours. </p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTA.html">the oceanic countryside’s like nationalist paint<br></a>
i recognized, rejected — remembering my school french-folds —</p>

<p>as fallow power flows through the shoulder. “where we going?”<br>
the con-pro from the party earlier turns to answer,</p>

<p>“if slow town’s supposed to lie in relations, its cousins<br>
    <a class="techne" href="STTA.html">sort of form a lineup, point out one way’s for another”</a></p>

<p>how else’d we understand that between joyous leisure time<br>
opposite familiar slow oblivionation</p>

<p>maybe there could still be a topology of options<br>
but with travel? to see with eyes unclouded by hatred.</p>

<p>“we all will be movers for work; yours is to lineate<br>
the rhythm in the open atmosphere-moment-volume-</p>

<p>calm-complex-generous-catastrophe-etcetera!”<br>
that’s the point the van crashes. the horizon terminates.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>a broken-open body, our con pro’s long vehicle’s<br>
    <a class="techne" href="STTA.html">foreshortened, accordioned. the unmoved backdrop’s full force-</a></p>

<p>’s quashed, truly, the moment we thought we were having over<br>
whatever prior geist or world-order we were against.</p>

<p>from eastward from the city, westward, we’re slouching back home-<br>
wards, our bedrooms, to sleep into separate apartments.</p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTB.html">put the curtains up and soft lights, just make the most</a><br>
    <a class="kairos" href="STKA.html">of the day’s diffusion, the minutia, rain-stained grey concrete.</a></p>

<p>where over that-a-way the sun blazes behind buildings,<br>
here, the moon rests in the shared parking lot; it’s just that still.</p>

<p>“life finds a way,” i guess. “a virus is like life.” i bring<br>
    <a class="techne" href="STTB.html">everything to the table, make tables on the table.</a></p>

<p><a class="kairos" href="STKA.html">if success is supposed to be just continuity,</a><br>
    “why wouldn’t you want to be successful?” i ask myself</p>

<p>where if i didn’t have to go but couldn’t stay, would i<br>
still want to be? the small feed of myself i see has been</p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTA.html">lagging, making a point and another one, shattering,<br></a>
making in between an imaginary momentum.</p>

<p>there’s got to be something more than just this. the banging starts.<br>
all the world around this part reveals its hardness. it’s here.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>then, “i think the perfect birthday party feels immortal<br>
to me. it does a double cleave. it’s a synecdoche</p>

<p>of the whole year in an evening and it evens out the year,<br>
you know (?), lets what is knowledge-able in it take the wheel</p>

<p>and peel out of there. just look at that horizon. expect<br>
good things for the birthday person, pet, or propinquiter.”</p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTC.html">propinquitry is the word which i’ve found myself, using</a><br>
a kind kind of sequencing, kind of like the day after </p>

<p>the birthday and all of the pleasure that exists in that.<br>
you would need a curved whole-world sized t-square to measure that.</p>

<p>“it’s a celebration for you to continue being<br>
yourself, you divide then recognize yourself wider than</p>

<p>when you began, for a moment more than what’s after<br>
all that marvels and disasters on feet, in parts, of clay.</p>

<p>it’s like all of the toasts in toronto have come your way.<br>
that’s what the perfect birthday party feels like anyway.”</p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTB.html">in all seriousness, i heard a person saying this.<br></a>
        <a class="kairos" href="STKA.html">my contemporaries would all gather and talk like it</a></p>

<p>truly just was what seemed like destiny to do. we went<br>
every possible way to make slow town seem possible.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>slow town, what it’s not, “i won’t let it just be ossified<br>
nostalgia porn: ruins and cabins with helmut newtons</p>

<p>on aeon-patina’d teak walls beneath the infinite<br>
ceiling mirrors my immediate imagination </p>

<p>cooks up, handsome dimensionless kitchens, storage for days,<br>
and a whole life reacting to the air.” there would be more.</p>

<p>“nor would the library only loan s. r. delany’s <br>
   <a class="kairos" href="STKC.html">dhalgren, r. gladman’s ravickians, any benjamin,</a></p>

<p>the weather (l. robertson), de rerum natura in<br>
english, jerusalem of emanating albion,</p>

<p>ulysses (the first quarter), life: a users manual…”<br>
    <a class="techne" href="STTC.html">definitely more than k. solie or i. calvino.</a></p>

<p>were it only a way of being in time together,<br>
a fast-held new-deal slow. “but in which i keep my own hours.</p>

<p>maybe i’ll feel some decelerating parameters<br>
but it may be just the gravity of living out life.”</p>

    <p><a class="techne" href="STTC.html">“woke mid-winter in a de chirico. not this either.”</a><br>
        <a class="kairos" href="STKB.html">“woke up eight-thousand years ago in lascaux, in between</a></p>

<p>the bull and illumination and it was not like this.”<br>
“as the very least leads me to guess, so slow town’s got it.”</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>the con-pro’s texting voice has relaxed, makes contact with mine.<br>
like, these short lines sent lace the aether contiguously.</p>

    <p><a class="kairos" href="STKC.html">for summer, all salutations wave thick in rainwater</a><br>
drops, interrupting thunderclaps. all, sun-dried up and out</p>

<p>by arrival, “and what an adventure it has all been.”<br>
“even we’re some lesson learned.” “the forest’s the leaves turning</p>

<p>in fog-machine mists” “how we get the epic and the still,”<br>
“and we’ve got the contemporary,” “more, we get connect-</p>

<p>ion going towards one another towards another.”<br>
“and where this is enough to observe” “that’s slow town, baby!”</p>

    <p><a class="kairos" href="STKB.html">i think the con-pro is an exciting kind of person;</a><br>
reads like a big fat yes! quixotic, yet affectionate.</p>

<p>always attentive to the counter-tempo, allegro<br>
pitter-patters of absolute collapse: “the azimuth’s</p>

<p>different from where you are and the sense you can hear nearing<br>
what’s got to be a consequence of life.” “whose life?” “who’s life</p>

<p>indeed? if i’d written it in greek, you wouldn’t ask me.”<br>
    <a class="kairos" href="STKC.html">i’ve been needing to remember this has happened before</a></p>

<p>and never quite like this; this cut the dialectic did<br>
to make a friendship in krisis, do we keep going in?</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>“a descent up from petri-stuff –– sea’s an agar plate-<br>
medium analogue –– a craft of world-like bodies by</p>

<p>generation. venture to gloss, when’s the agency in <br>
this viscous spread? then! what happened, without a doubt,’s like debt:</p>

<p>holes for the hyphae, a soft beach for the amphibious,<br>
a first recognition — a generous erotics of </p>

<p>novel compliments. friends collect at common accidents.<br>
who’s waiting for us to wash up as well? well? well well well…</p>

<p>if i see you, star, on the other side of the wide gyre,<br>
i suppose that i could see how you’d also end up here,</p>

    <p><a class="bios" href="STBA.html">it’s how i’ll learn to de-centre the individual,</a><br>
think drawing an imperfect circle, it’ll be the wrist</p>

<p>how we get the fleet immediate with deep historic<br>
texture: bumps, burrs, dramatic changes in the temperature</p>

<p>turning corners in a spiral. we surface in unknown <br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBA.html">water, like, from flat, we grew out of it; we carry it.</a></p>

<p>how we make without it (some good decisions and some bad<br>
embrained), shapes and takes life: can be a lost hard-dust decade,</p>

<p>maybe heavy waves, an angel –– just as arbitrary,<br>
what selects exigent habits.” next, we enter wreckage.</p>

<p>————————</p>

    <p><a class="bios" href="STBA.html">midst this wild life-of-the-mind i let myself find my feet</a><br>
heeding every caution, reaching out and being discreet</p>

<p>simultaneously, spending my late summer watching<br>
rain melt into the many undiscovered bridge rivers</p>

<p>‘round midtown toronto, very thoroughly green tunnels,<br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBA.html">very populous parks, subtle bubbles pulse and repulse</a></p>

<p>a shimmering of resemblances, little etiquettes<br>
run little circuits, imply what’s just before forever</p>

<p>(assuming a world will without your rapturous applause)<br>
pauses where judgement’s most clear, like, cleaved to the scenery</p>

    <p><a class="bios" href="STBB.html">like the lichen, like forking vines, like slime, like dopamine</a><br>
casts a spell on the walked forest bath i’ve kept attention</p>

<p>all this time to, the sediment: broken slabs of cement<br>
tent, keep the potential and haunt in open air under</p>

<p>the twin pinch ton of speculation and nimbyism.<br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBB.html">my heart expands. ruins run up that hill to the gardens,</a></p>

<p>builds an illusion of tension if you’re not used to it,<br>
but i can afford to be precarious and relaxed</p>

<p>knowing this erosion and, on a fun scale, entropy,<br>
and guessing where if there is a thrown down stone it could fall.</p>

<p>————————</p>

    <p><a class="bios" href="STBB.html">but what if it’s all growth, thus vital? coming from the wood-</a><br>
work’s the verse that binds this short life to time, climate, krisis</p>

<p>when you predicted but least expected it just like this:<br>
the eery the english can’t shut-up about. so confused</p>

<p>again. shores crash, intracontinental. o, toronto,<br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBB.html">the con-pro and i’ve, together, re-arrived to return.</a></p>

<p>we’ve learned from our separate sojourns. the lo-fi homework drones<br>
we shared to keep up an aesthetic of slow in common</p>

<p>resounded only so-so. still worth the experience,<br>
and anyway we’re here, and anyway we can go back,</p>

    <p><a class="bios" href="STBC.html">we will. “that’s that salmon sense against body’s origin”</a><br>
“i’m compelled to answer when i ask myself a question.”</p>

<p>our project, first to figure out a slow town in a year,<br>
was our energetic centre, that flickering over</p>

    <p><a class="krisis" href="STKrA.html">where we keep on going slow enough to get out of here.</a><br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBC.html">i get to meet the contemporary propinquiter</a></p>

<p>without much to say we’ve achieved; still, the epic demands<br>
a symmetry happens, and the c.p. seems familiar</p>

<p>to me. think infinite divisibility. think dreams<br>
    <a class="krisis" href="STKrA.html">of a shear cliff getting shearer and shearer in our trance.</a></p>

<p>————————</p>
    
    <p>  <a class="bios" href="STBC.html">still, being beholden to biographical writing,</a><br>
“what’s doing? what’s going? what’s having one over? what’s whole?”</p>

<p>— ding! — the whistle tolls. time’s evening so much it disappears <br>
into the mystery of our grassy conversation.</p>

<p>“hasn’t it been a real journey to get to this section?<br>
    <a class="bios" href="STBC.html">where’d all this ecology come from?” cold people get gone,</a></p>

<p>stretching off the grey-made park-scape, they speckle — dissipate — <br>
“why wait?” late september, already nearly my birthday,</p>

<p>seems like fate. an eleventh wave undertaking, “you sleep?” <br>
    <a class="krisis" href="STKrA.html">maybe a map over a mirror or a möbius</a></p>

<p>would describe best where ambitions, separated, could put us<br>
together. the c.p.’s answers curl around my questions</p>

<p>and make them happen again. against these ending seconds,<br>
every atomized white lie has that apocalyptic</p>

    <p><a class="krisis" href="STKrB.html">inner. behind the hill above the river, the long row’s</a><br>
bedroom brass lights imply silhouettes of activity;</p>

<p>their privacy and my negative capability<br>
cast shadows of their immediate futures, though the past,</p>

<p>all that seep, it’s completely inaccessible to me<br>
without reach, without invitation, “where’s the compulsion?”</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>some need the eye-to-eye. my terminator drive, seated<br>
in its own, personal, feed-lyric mode — no decisions — </p>

<p>for instance, slows every recognition down to the fold.<br>
is this the one loose thread from irreparability?</p>

    <p><a class="krisis" href="STKrB.html">who goes the wood-wound path that’s next to the major roadway?</a><br>
so many people don’t know me either. we’re floating heads</p>

<p>together in the rain. yellow-red watercolours. wet <br>
grey paper today reads another terrible number.</p>

<p>the very idea. the very idea. very<br>
    <a class="krisis" href="STKrB.html">much the way it is here, but there it is america.</a></p>

<p>there are individuals, and the individuals,<br>
they don’t fuck around, no, only purposively forward.</p>

<p>was it what was said? when had i forgotten? the shower?<br>
the swerve? it usually will occur to me — a feverous</p>

<p>shame, care –– somewhere. maybe being in-between things was where<br>
i got my verve from direction, i could not be contained.</p>

<p>looking for work, i’m practicing a newer signature.<br>
great! age will then blur it together as new characters</p>

<p>come. they’ll emerge and re-immerse after changing the trace,<br>
and so this will not be the same place i remain with you.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>many a torontonian’s interiority <br>
has manifested elsewise, ethically or not at all,</p>

<p>so who’s hindsight to list the worst until the next year doubles?<br>
the newier of us wouldn’t know the olds’ unheimlich</p>

<p>cold downtown, the belief they’ll keep building. midtown won’t stop<br>
still. fruit rots on a long vine, the vindictive mayor gives</p>

<p>neither techné nor charisma as actively nothing.<br>
it’s thin-ice, this kairos; you’d wonder why they wouldn’t fall</p>

    <p><a class="peira" href="STPA.html">over themselves to do the right thing. fear or a passion,</a><br>
    <a class="krisis" href="STKrC.html">that classic lattice i use when the sky and ground come loose:</a></p>

<p>and your perspective blooms, silky kind of thing to keep close<br>
at hand. whole spots –– totally transparent, a blue-light blush</p>

<p>of your room’s true season and just as quickly, elapsure. (?) <br>
    you said the weather over the phone, and i believed you </p>

    <p><a class="krisis" href="STKrC.html">so much. i wonder where this chasm between us is kept,</a><br>
at each of our chests’ centre divot? who knows? “i only</p>

<p>follow instructions as far as around the corner, and<br>
after that, it’s this century’s jazz age!” figuring out</p>

    <p><a class="peira" href="STPD.html">what to do at the vacuum you go all day for myself,</a><br>
i ask what to do when the world’s not having you over.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>re-reading blake’s take of genesis in milton, it’s in<br>
the just-keep-repeating of these strange names he makes. jesus!</p>

<p>it’s an anniversary, slow town calendar christmas<br>
    <a class="peira" href="STPA.html">already? what adversary fucks the burning turkey?</a></p>

<p>what’s the boundary? what’s core? feeling four folds to the world,<br>
till i am whose memory am i in(?). what’s mortal, friend?</p>

<p>what blends? aspects sunder and link, gleam like oil will in lakes.<br>
and our age passes, slow forum saturnalia, gone,</p>

<p>which offers a little peep-hole in the inspiration; <br>
you can see my apartment over the cemetery.</p>

<p>feels cement, this christmas body, holds weight closely without<br>
bending elbows as the unchanging lamb in my landscape</p>

<p>paint. there are days i feel the furniture, and there were days<br>
   i re-read calamities all to experience being</p>

<p>shook wide open to the world as petroleum close as<br>
undertow. still, whole generations of name intimate</p>

<p>this cooking dance, these physical wafts, crackles on the skin,<br>
the exact moment the night’s ever irreversible,</p>

    <p>all our heated porcelain, candles flimsily shadow,<br>
festive and horizonless, our table’s all over this.</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>“it seams sleep,” (seems?) one of the last things the c.p. told me,<br>
leaning deliberatively into the homophone,</p>

<p>before peacing out this winter, “the coincident slow.<br>
   somehow, the possibility keeps deep ahold of me.</p>

<p>that was slow town. where i arrived, as a piece of the earth<br>
was under my feet. impossible to think i exist</p>

<p>and it can’t.” and my contretemps, a hot stone in my throat, <br>
was decided silence as the rhythm we kept caved in</p>

    <p><a class="peira" href="STPB.html">with no generative negative, just – blip – an angel</a><br>
at the terminal: forward end out without turning round.</p>

<p>bye-bye. my life, the more i am awake, is dream enough;<br>
it’s relentlessly charming. the discreet pleasure, thinking</p>

<p>lower velocity, seeps out. doppled through the window<br>
is a quick city evangelism, a rumbling</p>

<p>current all ontario won’t do to make sense of its<br>
bad metabolism, worse attitude. necessity</p>

<p>demands, and the mayor calls the cops; that motherfucker<br>
can’t stop himself. still, with all of the time i know i have</p>

    <p><a class="peira" href="STPC.html">lately, an active slow – thorough – dreams itself in action:</a><br>
glittering open, the gate there is a contradiction.</p>

<p>————————</p>
    
<p>“but slow town should also be subject to a committee,<br>
read the contrapuntal city jazz (t. morrison) has.”</p>

<p>“read more history too, intimacies and their patterns,<br>
    <a class="peira" href="STPD.html">who’s occulting who from whom. you never knew what hit you.”</a></p>

<p>brickery colloquy, we are meeting in the valley.<br>
i’ve been needing to know more slow people. i realize</p>

<p>speaking, eye contact, doing the detective-of-textures<br>
thing is composing social slow over monotony</p>

    <p>(those heraclitean duodes). this long flux is for us.<br>
this beautiful scenery of browns, beige, and green water</p>

<p>flowers over. love’s got something outrageous in common.<br>
making friends, maybe dangerous, is form and content in</p>

<p>cooking up a moment, sometimes a decade, all soft-edged,<br>
    <a class="peira" href="STPC.html">calls itself forth, yet another tutelary daemon:</a></p>

<p>here, in the long reeds, it’s not as though we are camouflaged.<br>
relax, love’s courageous if an omen as well as loss.</p>

<p>long as you know you’re living, be the bodacious gaucho.<br>
    i won’t get the reference, but we’ve all got exposition</p>

<p>to give and you can also be an enigma to me.<br>
even here, between hills, we’re all still. such a vertigo.</p>
